    "Web spam detection is a crucial issue for web search engines. In fact, ranking algorithms such as PageRank cannot explicitly penalize spam websites in favor of trustworthy ones, meaning that users may find very high-rank pages that have no useful content and are highly ranked because they are part of a link farm, a popular way to fool ranking algorithms.\n",

    "###  The dataset\n",
    "The [WEBSPAM-UK2006](https://chato.cl/webspam/datasets/uk2006/) dataset contains 11402 hosts in the `.uk` domain, of which 7866 are labeled as *spam* or *normal*. Newer datasets have been released by the same authors, but this 2006 version remains the one with the highest number of manually labeled samples.\n",
    "\n",

For the purposes of this project, *undecided*-labeled hosts were considered unlabeled, leaving only 7866 hosts labeled as *spam* or *normal*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the file `uk-2006-05.hostgraph_weighted.txt` contains the weighted graph of the hosts, each row containing a host index, the indices of outlinked hosts and, for each of them, the number of outlinks.\n",

    "The function `read_graph` returns a sparse `csr_matrix` $R$, with $R[i,j]$ equal to $0$ if there is no edge connecting host $i$ to host $j$ or to $\\frac{1}{O[i]}$ where $O[i]$ is the total number of hosts outlinked by $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since PageRank algorithm requires a stochastic matrix, but there is no guarantee that each host has at least one outlink (dangling node problem), as proposed in [[1]](#references), an artificial node with a single self-loop was added to the graph, with ingoing edges from all dangling nodes."

    "### Evaluation of classifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "Some Machine Learning can be used to detect spam websites. Three different approaches are compared: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest. For all these classifiers, the implementation from `scikit-learn` library is used with its default hyperparameter values, with the exception of the parameter `class_weight`, which is set to `balanced` to try to mitigate the unbalance in the dataset between *spam* and *normal* labeled data points. \n",
    "\n",
    "The fit and test of these models is performed through a 10-fold cross validation. Regarding performance metrics, in a classification setting accuracy is obviously to be taken into account but, in this case, not sufficient to compare the models. In fact, given how unbalanced the dataset is, even a naive classifier that classifies all hosts as *normal* would achieve over 90% accuracy despite being completely useless for spam detection. To solve this problem, class-specific precision and recall statistics are taken into account for *spam* class. In particular, since spam labeling might be safety critical, one could imagine recall to be particularly relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tree-based classifiers work definitely better than Logistic Regression, scoring accuracies over 90% while attaining reasonable values for precision and recall on *spam* samples. However, Logistic Regression scores an outstading 95% recall on *spam* meaning that it succeeds in retrieving almost all spam hosts (at the cost of many false alarms, captured by low precision score)."
