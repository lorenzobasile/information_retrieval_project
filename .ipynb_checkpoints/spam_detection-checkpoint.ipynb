    "Web spam detection is a crucial issue for web search engines. In fact, ranking algorithms such as PageRank do not explicitly penalize spam websites in favor of trustworthy ones, meaning that users may find very high-rank pages that have no useful content and are highly ranked because they are part of a link farm, a popular way to fool ranking algorithms.\\\n",

    "The [WEBSPAM-UK2006](https://chato.cl/webspam/datasets/uk2006/) dataset contains 11402 hosts in the `.uk` domain, of which 7866 are labeled as *spam* or *normal*. Newer datasets have been released by the same authors, but this 2006 version remains the one with the highest number of manually labeled samples.\\\n",
    "The file `new_hostnames.csv` contains the names of the hosts in the dataset, while `webspam-uk2006-labels.txt` assigns to 8045 host names a label chosen among *spam*, *normal* or *undecided*. For the purposes of this project, *undecided*-labeled hosts were considered unlabeled, leaving only 7866 hosts labeled as *spam* or *normal*.\\\n",
    "Finally, the file `uk-2006-05.hostgraph_weighted.txt` contains the weighted graph of the hosts, each row containing a host index, the indices of outlinked hosts and, for each of them, the number of outlinks.\\\n",
    "The function `read_graph` returns a sparse `csr_matrix` $\\mathcal{R}$, with $\\mathcal{R}_{i,j}$ equal to the number of outlinks from host $i$ to host $j$ divided by the total number of outlinks of host $i$.\\\n",
    "Since PageRank algorithm requires a stochastic matrix, but there is no guarantee that each host has at least one outlink (dangling node problem), as proposed in Andersen et al., an artificial node with a single self-loop was added to the graph, with ingoing edges from all dangling nodes."
